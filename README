Description
===========

Prepare `ECF`_ submission files for results of chess games from events such as tournaments and leagues.

The ChessValidate package is used to validate documents reporting results of chess games.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is not available on PyPI, or any other package index, but can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user --trusted-host solentware.co.uk --find-links http://solentware.co.uk/wheels.html chesssubmit

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.

Then run 'python -m pip check' to identify other packages which need to be installed.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m chesssubmit.submit

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m chesssubmit.submit

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python -m chesssubmit.submit

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m chesssubmit.submit

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting results_report.


Notes
=====

The chesssubmit package supports the preparation of ECF submission files for events and their submission to the `ECF Rating System`_.

It adds these capabilities to the ChessValidate package without the use of database engines.  A consequence is each event is managed without reference to any other event:  `ECF codes and club codes`_ have to be collected separately for each event.

See the ChessValidate package README for requirements to accept various document formats such as *.docx or *.odt as source documents.
